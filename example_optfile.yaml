  The Federal Railway Administration has a record of a level railway crossing at {street}.
  Chances are that OSM does not have a crossing yet. If you see this:

  ![crossing](https://www.dropbox.com/s/aw5sm6gle51m63f/Screenshot%202015-07-05%2019.16.46.png?dl=1)

  OSM already has a crossing and you can skip the task.
  If the little `X` is missing where railway and road intersect,
  you may need to add a `railway=level_crossing` at the intersection node,
  and make sure the railway and the road share the node.
# A dictionary of field indices holding replacement values for the template string above.
# Make sure the length of this dict matches the number of placeholders in your string.
# Make sure that the keys match the named placeholders ({name}).
